# AoE2_RMS_TestZone

This is where I modify my map scripts and test them (and other whacky stuff) before publishing on the main mod.

The idea is for me to have some sort of history of what modifications I made to my maps and when.
(Because let's be honest, AoE2's mod history is close to useless for that)

Even tho this is made for private use, I made it public so people can see my code if they need (for some reason) and also so you can use the issues tab of GitHub for reporting bugs in maps without needing to contact me on discord (ilevelin#1160) or steam (/id/ilevelin).

## How to set up locally

~~Why would you want to do that, tho...~~

Just download the repo in `C:/Users/<your username here>/Games/Age of Empires 2 DE/<your SteamID here>/mods/local/`.
